# Music_Subcription_AWS
A comprehensive cloud-based web application developed entirely by me using various AWS services. This application allows users to register, log in, and manage their music subscriptions. The backend is powered by AWS services such as EC2, S3, API Gateway, Lambda, and DynamoDB, while the frontend is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
